**Short description** :

  > This project focuses on indoor growing using hydroponic technique.
  > As such, most of the feature/requirement develop is catered for it.
  > Currently, the system will be able to monitor current PH, EC and ambient lighting.
  > For the time being, i will not be able to upload some of the additional code as it is my Final Year Project. Will upload the full content when its ready. Cheers

# Features!

  - Ability to specify type of plant that is going to be grown using the system (Lettuce, Kale, etc..)
  - Automated PH & EC Dosing Mechanism
  - Current Plant Condition Monitoring in a friendly web interface
  - Automatically Turn On/Off light source depending on current ambient lighting

**Important Note**:
  - Some code/features is missing from the repo as it is an ongoing project for my FYP course

# Demo

LDR value update in **Real Time** as soon as the LDR sensor is covered with blackbox. (works with other sensors too)

## Installation

### Node-RED
Open Terminal and run the following code to install Node-Red

```sh
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/raspbian-deb-package/master/resources/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
```

### Arduino IDE
Open Terminal and run the following code to install Arduino IDE

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install arduino
```
## Running

Open Terminal and run the following code to start Node-RED
```sh
node-red-start
```
Verify the node-red is running by navigating to the default server address in your preferred browser 
```sh
127.0.0.1:1880
```
Import this [file](https://github.com/wadzee/automated-hydroponics/blob/master/flows.json) into Node-RED dashboard. 

**Note**
- Change the USB port to the correct port (the one where your Arduino is connected to).
- Be sure to swap out the `Sensor Data` file address to your own address to avoid conflict.

## Python Utilities and API

This repository now includes a `sensor_monitor.py` script for reading serial data from Arduino sensors and posting them to an API. The accompanying `api_server.py` provides a simple REST interface for storing readings in memory.

### Running the API Server

```sh
pip install flask
python api_server.py
```

### Mobile Web Interface

The `mobile/` directory contains a basic mobile-friendly page that fetches the latest sensor values. Run the API server and open `mobile/index.html` in your browser.
